# Job Search Web Scraper
This program scrapes the Ohio University jobs search page with a search query keyword that is input by the user as a command line argument. 

It then sends a Mac OS desktop notification with the results, which when clicked opens a browser window and automatically directs to that search result page at www.ohiouniversityjobs.com/postings/search.

Run by typing in the command line `python3 run.py software+developer` for example if you want to search for Software Developer jobs.
