# Job Search Web Scraper
This program scrapes the Ohio University jobs search page with a search query keyword that is input by the user as a command line argument. 

On OS X this program will run and provide notifications, on Windows the program will give you results in command line and subsequent errors about notifications (which are just for Mac OS X).

It then sends a Mac OS desktop notification with the results, which when clicked opens a browser window and automatically directs to that search result page at www.ohiouniversityjobs.com/postings/search.

Run by typing in the command line `python3 run.py software+developer` for example if you want to search for Software Developer jobs.
