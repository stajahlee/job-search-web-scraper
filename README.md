# Job Search Web Scraper
This program scrapes the Ohio University jobs search page, with search query keywords that are input. Then, on a scheduled basis, it sends me Mac OS desktop notifications with the results.

Run by typing in the command line `python3 run.py software+developer` for example if you want to search for Software Developer jobs.
